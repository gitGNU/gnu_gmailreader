0. REQUIREMENTS
===============

* OS: GNU/Linux, OpenBSD, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenSolaris, Mac OS X
      (if it doesn't work in any of those, let me know)
* Non-supported OS: Windows (although some parts of it may work on windows, I
                             don't expect all the features to work)
* Python version: 2.4 (it should work with anything greater than 2.4, if it
                       doesn't, let me know)
* libgmail: http://www.dcc.ufmg.br/~rafaelc/libgmail/
            (official version at http://libgmail.sourceforge.net)


1. GOAL
=======

The goal for this project is to create a simple and clean interface to gmail
e-mail which is capable of maintaining the label organization in the server.
This way we avoid the annoyance of having a screwed up web interface -- when
using gmail through pop3 -- while giving the user options to access the e-mails
without having to open a heavy browser.


2. INSTALL
==========

Use the setup.py script for installing the program. The only thing you have to
type is:

	% python setup.py install

Further help on the options (such as using a prefix) can be seen with the
following command:

	% python setup.py install --help


3. USING
========

Running gmailreader should get you a username and password prompt. You should
simple answer that with your gmail username (not the whole e-mail) and password.

After you're logged in you get into an interactive interface where you can type
commands to work with your e-mail. You can type "help" and a list with all the
commands will be presented to you.

As for now the project is on its very early stages, so I won't bother stating
all the commands here, which would just make it a new place to keep updating
after new commands are added.


4. LIBGMAIL
===========

This software is highly dependent on the work being done on libgmail. While I
always wanted to write software like this, I never quite had the will to learn
and play with gmail's javascript.

libgmail is licensed GPLv2 and, as for the time of this writing, I'm keeping a
slightly modified version of it on my personal webpage
(http://www.dcc.ufmg.br/~rafaelc/libgmail/). It's not a well
stabilished library yet, so I expect it to change a lot from one version to the
other. To make sure new changes won't break my software I keep the tested
version of libgmail on my website.


5. LICENSE
==========
While all the files in this package are BSD-licensed, the only way to use this
package is using the GPLv2-licensed library libgmail. That makes the whole
software to be a GPL-licensed.
