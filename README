Software license: BSD

doesn't, let me know)

1. GOAL
=======

The goal for this project is to create a simple and clean interface to gmail
e-mail which is capable of maintaining the label organization in the server.
This way we avoid the annoyance of having a screwed up web interface -- when
using gmail through pop3 -- while giving the user options to access the e-mails
without having to open a heavy browser.


2. LIBGMAIL
===========

This software is highly dependent on the work being done on libgmail. While I
always wanted to write software like this, I never quite had the will to learn
and play with gmail's javascript.

libgmail is licensed GPLv2 and, as for the time of this writing, I'm keeping a
slightly modified version of it on my personal webpage. It's not a well
stabilished library yet, so I expect it to change a lot from one version to the
other. To make sure new changes won't break my software I keep the tested
version of libgmail on my website.

I would distribute my software together with libgmail, but I don't know much
about the license deals, my software is BSD licensed not GPL, so I didn't want
to take any risks. Unless the author or someone who knows what he's talking
about tell me that's ok to just copy libgmail.py and lgconstants.py to my
project's package and not worry about anything else, I won't do it.


3. INSTALL
==========


4. USING
========

Running gmailreader should get you a username and password prompt -- more
details on how to skip this on section 5. You should simple answer that with
your gmail username (not the whole e-mail) and password.

After you're logged in you get into an interactive interface where you can type
commands to work with your e-mail. You can type "help" and a list with all the
commands will be presented to you.

As for now the project is on its very early stages, so I won't bother stating
all the commands here, which would just make it a new place to keep updating
after new commands are added.
